The dataset comprises 1074 rows and 10 columns.
It comprises (1074)companies, select investors (1058), industries Industry(16), continents (6), countries (46), cities (256), valuation, and funding.
I started the project by 
Understanding and gaining knowledge of the dataset
Extracting, Transforming, and loading of necessary libraries; such as pandas, numpy csv file, etc;
Data Inspection, cleaning, and Manipulation (checking for duplicates, null values, columns, missing values, data shape etc);
Data Exploration - Findings(creating relationships and insights such as:
How long it takes a company to become unicorn;
Which unicorn companies have had the biggest return on investment?
Which countries have the most unicorns?
Which investors have funded the most unicorns? etc
Finding -trend in unicorn company funding and industry across different continents
Recommendations/Conclusion
Challenges - not much information eg why the likes of Africa, and Oceania had little funding/industries presence, also why there were so much increment in joining the unicorn in 2015
