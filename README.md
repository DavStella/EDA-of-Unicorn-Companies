Python assignment June 2023
The dataset comprises 1074 rows and 10 columns with 1074 companies, select investors (1058), industries (16), continents (6), countries (46), cities (256), valuation, fundings, and date(founding and Joining).
I started the project by first
Understanding and gaining knowledge of the dataset
Extracting, Transforming, and loading of necessary libraries; such as pandas, numpy csv file, etc;
Data Inspection, cleaning, and Manipulation (checking for duplicates, null values, columns, missing values, data shape, etc);
Data Exploration: Findings (creating relationships and insights such as:
How long it takes a company to become unicorn;
Which unicorn companies have had the biggest return on investment?
Which countries have the most unicorns?
Which investors have funded the most unicorns?
Finding a trend in unicorn company funding and industry across different continents
Recommendations/Conclusion
Challenges: not much information, eg why the likes of Africa, and Oceania had little funding or industry presence, and also why there was so much increment in joining the unicorn in 2015
